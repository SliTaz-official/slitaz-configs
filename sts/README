SliTaz Tiny/Touch Screen desktop
===============================================================================


The goal of the sts desktop is to provide a nice experience on really small
screens such as a 320x240 2.8" TFT or 800x480 5" HDMI/VGA. The desktop uses 
Openbox window manager and LXpanel. Apps are started maximized and undecorated.
The top panel provides icons of opened applications and the hidden bottom panel
provides desktop switch and a close button for the current running application.

Sts can be used on any screen but was coded for custom i486/ARM flavors. These
flavors use a custom /etc/slitaz/applications.conf with sts-session as WM. Sts
can also be started by Slim or with startx and an appropriate ~/.xsession file.
